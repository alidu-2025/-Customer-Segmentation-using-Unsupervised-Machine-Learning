ðŸŽ¯ Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

#  Introduction
This project was completed as part of my internship with **Oasis Infobite**. It focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on behavioral patterns. The goal is to help businesses personalize marketing strategies and improve customer experience.

# Objective
Using unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering, the aim is to identify meaningful customer segments from a marketing dataset and visualize them to guide business decisions.

# Project Steps
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection & Scaling
4. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
5. Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
6. Cluster Interpretation & Visualization

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Findings
- Customers could be grouped into 4 distinct clusters.
- Spending behavior and recency were major differentiators.
- Visualizations provided actionable insights for targeted marketing.

#  How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone [https://github.com/alidu-2025/customer-segmentation.git
](https://github.com/alidu-2025/-Customer-Segmentation-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning/edit/main/README.md)
2. Navigate into the directory:
   cd customer-segmentation

3. Launch the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook M7T8_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb

# Acknowledgment
Big thanks to **Oasis Infobite** for mentoring and providing this learning opportunity!
